§ 820.1 Scope.
(a) Applicability. Current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) requirements are set forth in this quality management system regulation (QMSR). The requirements in this part govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the design, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, installation, and servicing of all finished devices intended for human use.
(b) Conflicts with other requirements under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The QMSR for devices in this part supplements regulations in other parts of this chapter except where explicitly stated otherwise. To the extent that any applicable requirements in this part conflict with requirements in other parts of this chapter, the regulations specifically applicable to the device in question shall supersede the more generally applicable requirements. Moreover, to the extent that any clauses of ISO 13485 conflict with any provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and/or its other implementing regulations, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and/or its other implementing regulations will control.
§ 820.3 Definitions.
Component means any raw material, substance, piece, part, software, firmware, labeling, or assembly that is intended to be included as part of the finished, packaged, and labeled device.

Section V.B. Scope (Pages 20-21)
FDA agrees with the portion of the comment that notes that the scope of the rule is appropriate and unchanged from the QS regulation. While FDA’s authority to promulgate quality systems regulations for devices extends to the components and parts of those devices, FDA has chosen, in this regulation, not to require components and parts to comply with the requirements of this rulemaking. FDA’s determination not to extend this regulation to manufacturers of components and parts does not preclude any contract between manufacturers that requires compliance with this rulemaking and is consistent with Clause 0.1 of ISO 13485. This scope also is consistent with the previous scope in the QS Regulation. FDA declines to incorporate third-party servicers and refurbishers into this rulemaking. FDA disagrees [with applying the rule to all entities required to register under section 510]; the scope of the QMSR and the scope of the registration requirements serve different objectives. Therefore, FDA disagrees that it would be appropriate to use registration requirements to determine which entities are subject to the QMSR.
Section V.F. Clarification of Concepts (Page 56)
FDA agrees that the phrases “safety and effectiveness” and “safety and performance” are not interchangeable, and although the proposed rule explained that FDA was not proposing that the terms were interchangeable, we have nevertheless revised this rule to avoid the potential for confusion. In accordance with section 520(f) of the FD&C Act, and as stated in § 820.1, the requirements of the QMSR are intended to assure that finished devices will be safe and effective and otherwise in compliance with the FD&C Act. FDA acknowledges that ISO 13485 and the FD&C Act utilize different phrasing related to device function and use... FDA’s intention is to reinforce that, despite the difference in terminology, the QMSR as a whole is intended to assure that finished devices will be manufactured to meet the statutory requirement for safety and effectiveness. We have revised the “clarification of concepts” section of the rule (proposed § 820.15, which is now included in § 820.3(b)) so that “safety and performance” has the meaning of “safety and effectiveness” only within the introduction in Clause 0.1 of ISO 13485. In the context of Clause 0.1 of ISO 13485, “safety and performance” means “assessment of the performance of the device to assure the device is safe and effective” as required by section 520(f) of the FD&C Act.
Section VI.A. Effective Date (Page 69)
FDA agrees that firms will need to become familiar with the QMSR, and FDA appreciates that manufacturers will need to make appropriate changes within their organizations to align their QMSs, processes, and documents with the QMSR. FDA also agrees that domestic firms may find that ISO 13485 is new to them, although FDA also considers ISO 13485 to be substantially similar to the requirements of the QS regulation. FDA has reconsidered the proposed effective date of 1 year, and in this rulemaking, sets an effective date of 2 years after publication in the Federal Register. FDA believes 2 years is adequate time for firms to align internal processes and procedures, to make appropriate changes within their organizations, and to update their documentation with the QMSR.

Conducts DHF audits to ensure 2019 regulatory readiness.

6.4 Clinical & Regulatory Affairs

Defines the clinical intended use and user needs.

Establishes the regulatory pathway and ensures global standard compliance.

7. PROCEDURE

7.1 Design and Development Planning
Each project begins with a formal Design and Development Plan (DDP) approved by the Project Steering Committee.

The DDP must define the design phases, the core team, and the organizational interfaces.

The plan shall assign responsibility for each design activity and include a schedule for formal reviews.

Legacy Note: The DDP is a static document. Any deviation from the plan requires a manual revision and re-approval via the Change Control Board (CCB).

7.2 Design Inputs (The DIS)
Design inputs are the foundational requirements for the device.

Engineering shall compile a Design Input Specification (DIS).

Inputs must be measurable, unambiguous, and address: functional, performance, safety, and regulatory requirements.

Design inputs must address risks identified in the preliminary Hazard Analysis.

Approval of the DIS occurs during the Gate 1 Design Review.

7.3 Design Outputs
Design outputs shall be documented and shall be expressed in terms that allow for adequate evaluation of conformance to design input requirements.

Outputs include drawings, specifications, software code, and Instructions for Use (IFU).

Engineering must identify Critical-to-Quality (CTQ) components.

Legacy Note: Design outputs must be approved by the Engineering Manager before they are used for formal Verification.

7.4 Formal Design Reviews
Formal reviews are conducted to evaluate the adequacy of the design.

Frequency: Reviews are mandatory at the end of each design phase (Concept, Input, Output, V&V, and Transfer).

Attendance: Requires a cross-functional team including at least one individual who does not have direct responsibility for the design stage being reviewed (the "Independent Reviewer").

Documentation: Minutes must include the date, participants, design revision being reviewed, and action items.

7.5 Design Verification (DV)
DV confirms that the design output meets the design input.

All DV testing must be conducted according to pre-approved protocols.

Testing must be performed on "representative" prototype units.

Legacy Sampling Rule: Statistical sampling for verification shall be based on a fixed confidence/reliability of 95/95 as per the 2018 Statistical Policy.

7.6 Design Validation (VAL)
VAL confirms the device meets user needs and intended uses.

Validation testing must be performed on initial production units or their equivalents produced under simulated production conditions.

Validation must include clinical evaluation or summative usability testing in the intended environment.

Testing must ensure that the device remains safe and effective for the duration of its stated shelf life.

7.7 Risk Management Integration (Compliance Trap)
Risk management is conducted as a separate track within the design process.

Preliminary Hazard Analysis (PHA): Conducted at project kickoff.

FMEA: A Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (dFMEA) shall be performed after the Design Output phase is complete and prior to Design Freeze.

Risk/Benefit Analysis: Compiled into a final Risk Management Report (RMR) at the end of the project.

Note for AI Update: The new QSMR (alignment with ISO 13485:2016) requires risk management to be iterative and integrated into every design decision, rather than a point-in-time "check" after outputs are generated.

7.8 Design Transfer
Design transfer ensures that the design is correctly translated into production specifications.

The Engineering Lead shall finalize the Device Master Record (DMR).

Production lines must be validated (Installation, Operational, and Performance Qualification - IQ/OQ/PQ).

Transfer is considered complete when the Plant Manager and Quality Director sign the physical Design Transfer Certificate.

7.9 Design History File (DHF) Management
The DHF is the repository for all design-related records.

The Engineering Lead maintains a DHF Index (Form-701) which tracks all document versions.

Legacy Format: The DHF is maintained as a physical "Master Binder" in the Central Vault, with digital backups in the legacy document management system.

Retention: DHFs shall be retained for 10 years after the product is discontinued.
